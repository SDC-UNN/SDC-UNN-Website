###<a name="overview"></a> Overview of the SRC
The SRC is a non-profit organization with members are mostly students from the 
Department of Computer Science and the Department of Electronics Engineering, 
both from the University of Nigeria, Nsukka. 
The organization hopes the expand in the nearest future to include students 
from other related departments in both the University of Nigeria and other 
universities. The SRC is structured into teams. Each team operates almost 
independently from others. An SRC member belongs to at least one team. 
Members in a team work and learn together under the direction of a team leader.

    * Automate member's registration process.
